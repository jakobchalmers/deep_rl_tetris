## Deep Reinforcement Learning Tetris with GUI

In this project, an agent is trained to play tetris on a 4x4 board with tiles of size 4 using traditional Q learning as well as deep Q learning.
The parameter sets in tetris.py controls whether to use the normal or deep Q learning agent, or play manually.
One can also change whether the tiles come in a fixed order or stochastically.
